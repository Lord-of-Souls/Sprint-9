# BI Driven Decision-making & A/B Testing Optimization

## Description
This project focuses on the systematic prioritization and validation of business strategies through A/B testing and statistical analysis. It utilizes a Business Intelligence (BI) approach to evaluate the impact of various hypotheses on key user metrics, ensuring that product implementations are based on mathematical significance rather than intuition.

## Project's Objective
The primary goal is to compile and analyze a set of business hypotheses, conduct A/B tests to measure their impact, and use statistical tools to determine which changes should be prioritized for implementation.

## Results
- **Hypothesis Prioritization:** Ranked business ideas using frameworks like ICE or RICE to optimize resource allocation.
- **A/B Test Conclusions:** Clearly identified winning variants with statistically significant improvements in conversion or engagement.
- **Visual Evidence:** Distribution plots and cumulative metric charts that highlight the divergence between Control and Test groups.
- **Scientific Validation:** Confirmed results using P-values to eliminate the possibility of random noise in the data.

## Methodology
The project follows a rigorous experimental design as of 2026:
1.  **Hypothesis Compilation:** Gathering and scoring potential business improvements.
2.  **Preliminary Analysis:** Checking data distribution and sample sizes to ensure test power.
3.  **A/B Testing execution:** Splitting user groups and tracking performance across specific KPIs.
4.  **Statistical Inference:** Applying T-tests or Z-tests to calculate significance.
5.  **Visualization & Reporting:** Presenting the cumulative revenue or conversion trends to justify business decisions.

## Utilized Tools
- **Data Manipulation:** [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) & [NumPy](https://numpy.org).
- **Statistical Testing:** [SciPy](https://scipy.org) (Inferential testing).
- **Visualization:** [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) & [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org).
- **Environment:** [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org).

## Acquired/Developed Abilities
- **A/B Test Design:** Mastering group splitting, duration calculation, and metric selection.
- **Hypothesis Prioritization:** Using quantitative scoring to manage project backlogs.
- **Inferential Statistics:** Interpreting P-values and confidence intervals within a business context.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Ability to translate complex statistical results into clear implementation recommendations.

## Upgrades to be Made
- [ ] Implement Bayesian A/B testing methods for more flexible real-time analysis.
- [ ] Add Segmentation analysis to identify if specific tests performed better on certain demographics.
- [ ] Automate the visualization of "Winner" detection using a custom Python module.

## How to Run It
You can run the project files in two ways:

### Option 1: Google Colab
1. Upload the `.ipynb` files directly to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Run the cells sequentially.

### Option 2: Local Environment (VS Code)
1. Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.orgdownloads/) installed.
2. Install the **Jupyter Extension** in VS Code.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file and select your Python interpreter.
